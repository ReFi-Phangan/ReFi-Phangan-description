ReFi Phangan

Project name: Air Quality TG bot with live notifications on current air condition + Chatgpt recomendations 

Description: Air quality is increasingly contributing to lung and respiratory diseases and reducing the quality of life for people. Unoptimized waste management systems and industrial waste incineration, including plastic, are causing an increase in cancer rates. The pressure on the environment due to human activity is increasing every year, especially noticeable in the global south, specifically on the island of Koh Phangan.

One of the initiatives of the ReFI Phangan project is to create a Telegram bot with real-time notifications about the current state of the air, along with recommendations to reduce negative impacts on health. For example, with an AQI (US EPA) of 101-150, it is recommended to keep windows closed, use air purifiers, and avoid outdoor activities. An important feature will be ChatGPT, which will provide personalized notifications and answer users' questions related to the context and general knowledge about the environment and humans. With care for local communities, the bot will communicate in Thai, Burmese, English, and other languages.

We see how users can increase their awareness and knowledge of the quality of the environment and their personal contribution to ecosystem and community health.

The first stage will be to launch a test bot with requests for API data on air quality and raw notifications. The second stage will be to launch a bot that works with ChatGPT to provide basic recommendations. The third stage will be to add the ability to ask ChatGPT questions.

We welcome people who want to support the creation of the bot. Thank you.
