### Our Mission

ReFi Phangan is dedicated to addressing environmental issues on Koh Phangan by fostering community engagement and leveraging web3 technologies to amplify our impact. We are spearheading a transformational approach to waste management on the island, which includes promoting sustainable practices among locals, tourists, and foreign residents, as well as establishing a full-circle plastic recycling facility.

### Our Achievements

In the past year, ReFi Phangan organized multiple cleanups, including monthly Earth Day events and the Labor Day Cleanup, removing significant amounts of waste from natural environments. We held 6 Regen Full Moon events and several onboarding sessions, introducing over 100 residents to regenerative finance and sustainable practices. Additionally, we successfully onboarded the Clean Phangan community to web3 through the Impact Product - NFT collection by EcoSynthesisX, creating a new revenue stream for ongoing environmental efforts.

### Our Goals

**To Boost Community Onboarding and Education**
ReFi Phangan is a pioneer of regenerative finance on Koh Phangan, focusing on community building through onboarding events to introduce more local communities, NGOs, and individuals to web3 technologies and ReFi. Additionally, we aim to organize sustainability-focused events and mini-workshops in collaboration with existing activists on the island.

**To Expand Cleanups and Environmental Initiatives**
ReFi Phangan aims to increase the frequency and scale of cleanup activities on Koh Phangan by promoting [Monthly Earth Day](https://x.com/highlyartistic?s=21) cleanups. This initiative will help reduce plastic pollution and prepare the population to follow important steps in plastic waste management, which are essential for succeeding with the next goal.

**To Establish the Re:Plast Full Circle Recycling Facility**
Our epic goal is to benefit the environment of the entire island by organizing and providing the necessary support for the local government or village community to start running a dedicated recycling center for converting plastic waste into sustainable products based on the [Precious Plastic program](https://www.preciousplastic.com). This will build local recycling infrastructure, engage the community in recycling practices, and produce eco-friendly products that will become an additional source of income for the local economy.
